# pika-rabbitmq

As part of a major microservice migration research project where I am contributing as a Solutions Architect I had to support development with some microservice coding for a PoC.
The consumer/producers are using pika to connect to a RabbitMQ instance and need to work in parallel to send and receive messages from/to the broker.
